# absolute-directory-test
a test to see if a link to `/` (`<a href="/">test</a>`) goes to the home page of https://qanazoga.com 

(the page is hosted from this project instead of from here instead of from [qanazoga/qanazoga.github.io](https://github.com/qanazoga/qanazoga.github.io)

update: it works
